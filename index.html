            One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. 
            It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with 
            its individual chapters compiled into 102 tankōbon volumes as of April 2022. The story follows the
